description: In the 22nd century, Earth's natural resources have dwindled to the point
  of extinction, and as a result, the residents of the planet are on a never-ending
  quest to find new places to inhabit on other worlds. But some of these planets are
  already populated by other creatures -- some of whom aren't overly eager to welcome
  their new neighbors.
